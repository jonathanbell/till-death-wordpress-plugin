Till Death Wordpress Plugin
===========================

Displays how old Jonathan Bell is in real time in the format years:months:days:hours:seconds. It's a Wordpress plugin that I use on [30.jonathanbell.ca](http://30.jonathanbell.ca).

Thanks to @mckamey (https://github.com/mckamey/countdownjs). Thank you.

It really should be called "How Long Alive" but "Till Death" just sounds way cooler.
